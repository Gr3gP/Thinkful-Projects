# Thinkful-Projects
These are data science projects I did while enrolled at Thinkful. 

The Projects and a brief description are:

Active Satellites in Earth Orbit
  - hypothesis testing for the relationship between masses of satellite in different Earth orbits.

Identifying Celestial Bodies
  - I used dimensionality reduction and clustering models to tag different types of celestial bodies.

Pulsar Star Identification with SL
  - This project sought to tag pulsar stars using KNN, Random Forest, SVM, and Gradient Boosted models. 

DataDriven: MagNet Competition
  - This model was for a competition hosted by DataDriven. I built an LSTM network to predict the strength of Earth magnetosphere at current and future intervals.
